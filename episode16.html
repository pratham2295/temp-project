      Eren Yeager (エレン・イェーガー Eren Yēgā?) was a former member of the
      Survey Corps. He was the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in
      Shiganshina District with his parents until the fall of Wall Maria, where
      he impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan.[32] This event
      would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe
      all of them off the face of the Earth.[33]
