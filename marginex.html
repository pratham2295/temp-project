      The timeout may not be a skill they work long hours to perfect, it may not
      require expert coaching, but it can – if used correctly – be a weapon as
      important as any in their arsenal. And unlike the forehands and backhands
      and Tomahawk serves, they cannot keep using it. They have one. Timing, as

      Hasmukhbhai Patel and China’s world No 3 Zhang Miao. The match that went
      the distance and finished in the Indian’s favour, had plenty of exciting
